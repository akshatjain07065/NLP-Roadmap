Here's a **detailed study plan** for learning **One-Hot Encoding, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe**, along with step-by-step implementation guidance.  

---

## **📌 Detailed Study Material**  

### Learn One-Hot Encoding, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe 

#### ✅ **One-Hot Encoding**  
📌 **Concept:**  
- Represents words as binary vectors.  
- Each unique word gets a vector with **1 at a specific index** and **0 elsewhere**.  
- Simple but inefficient for large vocabularies (high dimensionality & no semantic relationships).  

📖 **Study Material:**  
- [One-Hot Encoding Explained](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/)  

🛠 **Hands-on Practice:**  
☐ Implement one-hot encoding using `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`  
☐ Write a custom Python function for one-hot encoding  

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
import numpy as np

# Example Corpus
corpus = ["cat", "dog", "fish", "cat", "dog", "cat"]

# Convert to NumPy array and reshape
corpus_array = np.array(corpus).reshape(-1, 1)

# Apply One-Hot Encoding
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
one_hot_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(corpus_array)

print(encoder.categories_)
print(one_hot_encoded)
```

**Notebooks:**

- [One-Hot Encoding Notebook](one_hot_encoding.ipynb)

---

#### ✅ **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**  
📌 **Concept:**  
- Measures word importance in a document relative to a collection (corpus).  
- Helps filter out common words and highlight important ones.  
- Used for **document similarity, search engines, and text classification**.  

📖 **Study Material:**  
- [TF-IDF Intuition & Math](https://towardsdatascience.com/tf-idf-explained-and-python-implementation-1fa413b1474b)  

🛠 **Hands-on Practice:**  
☐ Implement **TF-IDF** using `scikit-learn`  
☐ Visualize TF-IDF values  

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample Corpus
documents = [
    "Natural Language Processing is fun",
    "I love learning NLP",
    "NLP is a subfield of AI",
]

# Initialize TF-IDF Vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Convert to array
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(tfidf_matrix.toarray())
```

---

#### ✅ **Word2Vec (Word Embeddings)**  
📌 **Concept:**  
- Converts words into dense **vector representations** that capture meaning.  
- Uses **CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)** and **Skip-gram** models.  
- Words with similar meanings have **closer vector representations**.  

📖 **Study Material:**  
- [Word2Vec Explained](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec)  
- [Understanding CBOW vs. Skip-gram](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/03/what-is-word2vec/)  

🛠 **Hands-on Practice:**  
☐ Train **Word2Vec** using `gensim`  
☐ Visualize word similarities  

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from gensim.utils import simple_preprocess

# Sample Corpus
sentences = [
    "Natural Language Processing is amazing",
    "I love deep learning and NLP",
    "AI and Machine Learning are closely related",
]

# Tokenize sentences
tokenized_sentences = [simple_preprocess(sentence) for sentence in sentences]

# Train Word2Vec model
model = Word2Vec(sentences=tokenized_sentences, vector_size=50, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)

# Check word similarity
print(model.wv.most_similar("learning"))
```

## **🚀 Summary of Tasks & Checklist**  

☐ **One-Hot Encoding**  
☐ Implement one-hot encoding with `sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder`  
☐ Write a custom Python function for one-hot encoding  

☐ **TF-IDF**  
☐ Learn TF-IDF formula and its intuition  
☐ Implement TF-IDF using `TfidfVectorizer` in `scikit-learn`  

☐ **Word2Vec**

☐ Download & load pre-trained GloVe embeddings  
☐ Use GloVe vectors for NLP tasks  

#### ✅ **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)**  
📌 **Concept:**  
- Unlike **Word2Vec**, which predicts context words from a target word, **GloVe** uses word **co-occurrence statistics** from a large corpus.  
- Captures semantic relationships effectively.  
- Used in **text classification, recommendation systems, and chatbots**.  

📖 **Study Material:**  
- [Stanford GloVe Paper](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)  
- [GloVe vs. Word2Vec](https://towardsdatascience.com/glove-vs-word2vec-approximate-co-occurrences-and-train-a-word-embedding-model-from-scratch-8f225a6b21aa)  

🛠 **Hands-on Practice:**  
☐ Download **GloVe embeddings**  
☐ Load and use GloVe vectors  

```python
import numpy as np

# Load GloVe word embeddings
glove_file = "glove.6B.50d.txt"

word_embeddings = {}
with open(glove_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for line in f:
        values = line.split()
        word = values[0]
        vector = np.asarray(values[1:], dtype="float32")
        word_embeddings[word] = vector

# Example: Find similar words
word = "king"
print(f"Embedding for '{word}':\n", word_embeddings[word])
```
